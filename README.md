- 👋 Hi, I’m @tanikajangam– I turn caffeine into code and ideas into projects.
- 👀 I’m interested in making projects that makes the world a little better. And maybe automating my chores. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to stop breaking things during production (luckily have been doing that a lot less).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that involve newer technologies, or just an excuse to learn something new.
